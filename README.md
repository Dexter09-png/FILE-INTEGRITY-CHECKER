In today's digital world, keeping files safe and unaltered is more important than ever. Whether it’s a confidential document, a configuration file, or a software update, even a tiny change in a file can lead to major problems. This project is all about building a simple yet powerful tool using Python that helps check whether a file has been changed intentionally or accidentally by comparing its hash values. The tool is called a File Integrity Checker. It works by generating something called a hash value using the SHA-256 algorithm, which is a type of digital fingerprint for a file. If even a single character in the file changes, the hash will look completely different. This makes hashing an excellent way to detect changes in files. The script I built does exactly that. It asks the user to enter two file paths. Then, it calculates the SHA-256 hash for both files and compares them. If the hashes match, that means the files are identical. If they don’t, it means something has changed and the tool will display both hash values so the user can clearly see the difference. I chose Python for this project because it’s easy to understand and widely used. The script uses Python’s built-in hashlib module, so it doesn’t need any extra software or complicated installations. It’s lightweight, cross-platform, and works on any computer with Python installed. This tool can be useful in many real-life situations. For example, if you’re a system administrator, you can use it to check if someone tampered with an important file. If you're a developer working on a project, you can make sure your code files haven’t been accidentally edited or corrupted. It’s a simple way to stay in control of your data and maintain file authenticity. I have used applications like Trea, VS code and Ideal to run this code to make it work. It doesn’t require technical knowledge beyond running a Python script and entering file names. Yet behind the scenes, it performs a powerful function giving users peace of mind that their files haven’t been tampered with. I've gathered this all information and gained my knowledge from various platforms like YouTube, ChatGPT, Google websites and so on. 

In conclusion, this project shows how a basic concept like hashing can be used in a practical and effective way. The File Integrity Checker offers a simple solution to a big problem: keeping files safe and unchanged. It's a great example of how programming skills can be used to build real-world tools that help improve digital security and reliability.
